# eslint-plugin-jimu-theme

This plug-in is used to assist in migrating jimu-theme variables to the new version.

## Installation

You'll first need to install [ESLint](https://eslint.org/):

```sh
npm i eslint --save-dev
```

Next, install `eslint-plugin-jimu-theme`:

```sh
npm install eslint-plugin-jimu-theme --save-dev
```

## Usage

Add `jimu-theme` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:

```json
{
    "plugins": [
        "jimu-theme"
    ]
}
```


Then configure the rules you want to use under the rules section.

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "jimu-theme/rule-name": 2
    }
}
```

## Note

This plugin is only for assisting in `jimu-theme` upgrades and should not be used for other purposes.


The `no-classic-*` rules are used to upgrade corresponding variables, for example:

```
theme.colors.primary => theme.sys.color.primary.main
```

Rule `no-classic-variables` contains all other rules prefixed with `no-classic` (except rule `no-classic-css-utilities`,  `no-classic-css-vars`), so you can choose to replace them with rule `no-classic-variables`.

The rule `no-unnecessary-template-vars` is intended to clean up abnormal code after a theme upgrade, such as:

```
~~const style = `color: ${'transparent'};`~~

const style = `color: transparent;`
```

The rule `no-unnecessary-template-vars` need to be placed after `no-classic-*`.

Then put rule `no-classic-variables-left` after all rules to check whether any classic theme variables are not recognized.

Furthermore, after automatic fixing, there might still be incorrect code remaining, which requires reviewing each file individually.

For example:

Before fixing:
```js
const colors = theme.colors
const primary = colors.primary
```
After fixing:
```js
const colors = theme.colors
const primary = theme.sys.color.primary.main
```
You can see that after the fix, a variable named "theme" is missing, and the definition of the "colors" variable is no longer needed. These require further manual processing.
If you perform global automatic fixing, you need to pay attention to the warning and error messages eslint prints on the console to complete this part of the manual fixing.

We recommend autofixing files one by one rather than applying a global autofix directly.
