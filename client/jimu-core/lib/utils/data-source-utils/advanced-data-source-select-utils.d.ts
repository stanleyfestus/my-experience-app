 * Select all records by current selection and `selectionMode`. `selectionMode` is to indicate how the new select operation affects the original selection.
 * If `selectionMode` is `DataSourceSelectionMode.New`, then the new selection records are the queried records by the `query` parameter.
 * If `selectionMode` is `DataSourceSelectionMode.AddToCurrent`, then the new selection records include the current selection records and the queried records by the `query` parameter.
 * If `selectionMode` is `DataSourceSelectionMode.RemoveFromCurrent`, then the new selection records are obtained via deleting the queried records by the `query` parameter from the current selection records.
 * If `selectionMode` is `DataSourceSelectionMode.SelectFromCurrent`, then the new selection records are the intersection of the current selection records and the queried records by the `query` parameter.
 *
 * This method will resolve null if the signal is aborted and the selection is not updated.
