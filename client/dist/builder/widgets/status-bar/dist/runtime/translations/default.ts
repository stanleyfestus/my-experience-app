  fixedLayoutDesc: 'For widgets in full-screen pages or fixed layouts (e.g., Fixed Panel, Card, List, etc.), turning on this option will automatically calculate their tab orders based on positions so that they sync up with the visual order for a better experience when it comes to accessibility support. This option will affect the overlay of widgets, so you may want to move certain elements forward or backward for desired results.'
