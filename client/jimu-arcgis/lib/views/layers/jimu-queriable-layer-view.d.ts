 * `JimuQueriableLayerView` is the wrapper of queryable layers. A queryable layer is a layer that can query features, having a specific `JimuQueriableLayerView` and `ArcGISQueriableDataSource` corresponding to it.
 * `JimuQueriableLayerView` is used to synchronize state with `ArcGISQueriableDataSource`. For example, `FeatureLayer` is corresponding to `JimuFeatureLayerView` and `FeatureLayerDataSource`.
 * When a widget updates the feature selection of `FeatureLayerDataSource`, `JimuFeatureLayerView` will highlight these selected features on the map.
